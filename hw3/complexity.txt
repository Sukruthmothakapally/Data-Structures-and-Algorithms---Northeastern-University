Time complexity for the first for loop - since it's iterating i from 1 to n/2 and then j from 2 * i to n, it has time complexity of O(n^2/2)

Time complexity for the second for loop - since it's iterating i from 1 to n, it has time complexity of O(n)

Hence, total time complexity -> O(n^2/2) + O(n) -> O(n^2/2 + n) which is O(n^2)
